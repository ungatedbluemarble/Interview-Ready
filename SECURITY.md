# Security Policy

## Overview

Interview Ready is a Claude skill package consisting of markdown instruction files. It does not include executable server code, databases, authentication systems, or network services. The attack surface is intentionally minimal.

That said, security matters here for specific reasons. This package handles sensitive personal information , career history, compensation targets, employment status, and job search motivations. It also generates guidance that job seekers will act on in real situations. Getting that wrong has real consequences for real people.

## Supported Versions

Security issues are addressed in the current version on the `main` branch only. We do not maintain security patches for older versions.

---

## What to Report

Please report any of the following:

**Data exposure risks**
Anything in the skill files that could cause Claude to expose, store, or transmit a user's personal information in an unintended way. This includes prompt patterns that could cause the profile JSON to be surfaced inappropriately.

**Prompt injection vulnerabilities**
Patterns in the skill instructions that could be exploited through malicious job descriptions, resume content, or other user-supplied input to cause Claude to take unintended actions.

**Misleading or harmful guidance**
Content in any skill file that gives job seekers advice that is factually wrong, legally incorrect, or likely to cause harm in a real job search situation. This includes outdated salary law information, incorrect EEOC guidance, or negotiation advice that could damage a candidate's position.

**License violations in contributions**
If you identify contributed content that appears to violate the CC BY-NC 4.0 license, contains copyrighted material used without permission, or includes real personal data from identifiable individuals, report it.
